# AlmostThere
AlmostThere! An app to notify you when you're almost at your bus stop, just in case you weren't paying attention.

C'mon, we've all done it - in this technologically-oriented day and age, it's hard to peel our eyes away from our screens. For the Algonquin College Inaugural hackathon, I decided to solve one of my own problems - on multiple occasions, I've missed my bus stop after becoming too engrossed with my device. AlmostThere! allows the user to pick their Ottawa bus stop and set a reminder to cool it with the cell phone until the bus arrives at its destination. Using proximity alerts, the application will notify the user once they penetrate a 200 metre radius around the bus stop. Upon this event, the phone will vibrate for 5 seconds and trigger toast notifications to ensure that you're on the ball and off the bus.  I'll never miss my stop ever again, and it was an excellent way to get down and dirty with Android programming.
